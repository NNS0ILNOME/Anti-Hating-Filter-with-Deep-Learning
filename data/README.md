# Dataset

This project uses a text dataset to train the anti-hating filter.

## Content
In this folder there is the file:
- **`Filter_Toxic_Comments_dataset.csv`** — contains text comments and their labels (`0` = not offensive, `1` = offensive) across six hate categories.

## Dataset description
Each line in the file represents an example, with the following main columns:

| Column | Description |
|-----------------|------------|
| `comment_text`| Textual content of the comment or phrase |
| `toxic`| Binary tag for toxic content |
| `severe_toxic`| Binary tag for highly toxic content |
| `obscene`| Binary tag for obscene language |
| `threat`| Binary tag for threats |
| `insult`| Binary tag for insults |
| `identity_hate`| Binary tag for hatred towards specific identities |
| `sum_injurious`| Sum of previous tags |
